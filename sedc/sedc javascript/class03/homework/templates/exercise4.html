    <h2>Write a function that takes two numbers: the numbers of girls and boys in a team. 
        Print these numbers in console, but add girls and boys correspondingly after them.
         Example, if the input is 4, 7, the function should print 4 girls 7 boys.

        Bonus:
        
        For numbers less than 10, add 0 before them. 
        For the above example that would be 04 girls 07 boys.</h2>
