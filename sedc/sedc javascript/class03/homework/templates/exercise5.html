    <title>Homework part 5- The age calculator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

        Write a function named calculateAge that:
        takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
        calculates the age based on those years.
        outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are NN years old"
        Call the function three times with different sets of values.
        Hint: don't think about the months
        Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.</h2>
